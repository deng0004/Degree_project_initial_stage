# degree_project_initial_stage

## The focus of the files in this repository are the images and the python code. 


## PYTHON CODE EXPALNATION

The code of this project was written in Python language, specifically name is called Micropython language. It used some similiar properties of normal Python language. 

In Micropython, there are some special modules which I learned througout this project. 

Example: 
```
from machine import Pin, ADC, 
- used to declare the Pins and Analog to Digital Conversion
import network as MOD_NETWORK, used to connect to wifi 
try:
  import usocket as socket
except:
  import socket, used for websocket connection

```

One of the image, which is called [data_show_in_table_through_website.PNG](https://github.com/deng0004/degree_project_initial_stage/blob/main/data_show_in_table_through_website.PNG), showed the data collected by 2 MQ2 gas sensors. The collected data will be display in a localhost website. 

Besides, the image name [esp32_with_2_mq2.jpg](https://github.com/deng0004/degree_project_initial_stage/blob/main/esp32_with_2_Mq2.jpg) showed the connection of an ESP32 mirocontroller with 2 MQ2 gas sensors.

Also, with the image named with [firebase_data_with_2_mq2.PNG](https://github.com/deng0004/degree_project_initial_stage/blob/main/firebase_data_with_2_mq2.PNG) showed the collection of MQ2 gas sensor data stored in reatime Database.
